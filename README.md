# Lab-1.2---Code-Challenge


# Description of the repository
  In this repository are my codes of the lab 1.2

# How to build and run
  I use the eclipse IDE for build and run all the programs I made.

# Performance Summary conclusions 
  In this programs there is not memory or CPU issues, because they are a simple programs. The complexity of the 3 programs are O(n^2). In the second and third program I use a insertion sort, that is why the complexity is O(n^2). In the second program the biggest problem was that the user can add a integer at any time they want. In the last program the biggest problem was that we have to create the random list of the prohibited numers.
