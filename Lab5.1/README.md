<h1>Managing Memory</h1>
On all computer systems memory is a scarce resource. No matter how much memory is available, it never seems to be enough. It doesnâ€™t seem so long ago that 256MB of RAM was considered sufficient, but now 2GB of RAM is commonplace as a sensible minimum requirement even for desktop systems, with servers usefully having significantly more.


Linux provides protection so that different applications are protected from each other, and it allows applications to apparently access more memory than is physically present in the machine, provided the machine is at least well configured and has sufficient swap space.
